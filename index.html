        <h1>Hi, I'm Tom Bond</h1>
        <h3>A copywriter specialising in sustainability and technology.</h3>
 <img src="images/desk.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 5%">
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I have a Documentary Photography degree from the University of South Wales and an MSc in Sustainability &amp; Adaptation from the Centre for Alternative Technology.</p>
<h3>Voluntary</h3>
<p>I gladly give some of my time to non-profits working for a more sustainable world - if that's you, get in touch.</p>
<h3>Experiences</h3>
<p>In May 2017 I finished a five-year term as an elected Labour councillor in Newport. To chase new adventures, I decided not to stand for a second term.</p>
<p>Beyond the council, I've been a school governor, charity trustee, and company director. At university, I became student president.</p>
<p>I'm really lucky to enjoy what I do. These days, I work at <a href="https://www.flag.co.uk/" target="_blank">Flag</a>, helping to produce corporate sustainability reports and communications. I've also got a grounding in conversion optimisation, marketing and SEO.</p>
<h3>Passions</h3>
<p>My favourite objects include my running shoes, gaming PC, cameras and photography books. Writing, environmentalism, politics and technology are some of my other big things.</p>
